# Developer Tool Promotion Strategy

A research-based guide for promoting bdg to the developer community.

## The Core Principle

**Developers hate marketing.** They respond negatively to hype and advertising. What works is **solving real problems and proving it with data**—which we already have (benchmarks, token efficiency).

> "Developer audience hates marketing. The level of hate is extreme, unreasonable even."

## High-Impact Channels

| Channel | Why It Works | Effort |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Hacker News** | Brutal but high reach. One good Show HN can drive thousands of signups | Medium |
| **Reddit** | r/LocalLLaMA, r/ClaudeAI, r/webdev—niche communities trust peer recommendations | Low |
| **GitHub Trending** | Stars = social proof. 1,000+ stars signals legitimate adoption | Ongoing |
| **Dev.to / Hashnode** | Technical tutorials rank well, attract organic traffic | Medium |
| **Twitter/X** | AI/dev influencers amplify good tools. Tag relevant people | Low |
| **Discord communities** | Claude, AI coding, web dev servers—direct engagement | Low |

## What Actually Works

### 1. Lead with the Problem, Not the Solution

- "MCP dumps 52K tokens per page" → "bdg does it in 1.2K"
- Your benchmark article is perfect for this
- Developers want to see clearly how your product works, the problems it solves, and the value it provides

### 2. Enable Hands-On Experience Immediately

- `npm install -g browser-debugger-cli@alpha` right at the top
- No signup, no contact forms—just `bdg example.com`
- "Find a way to help them get what they want: a free trial, some hands-on experience, and no contact forms in the way."

### 3. Educational Content Over Promotion

- Write tutorials: "How to debug memory leaks with an AI agent"
- Show workflows, not features
- Key content types: Documentation, source code, tutorials and guides

### 4. Be Transparent About Limitations

- "Alpha stage, Windows not native yet" builds trust
- Developers smell BS instantly
- "Be open and honest about what your tool can and can't do. Developers value transparency."

## Tactical Playbook

### Week 1-2: Foundation

- [ ] Post on Hacker News (Show HN: bdg – CLI for AI agents to control Chrome, 33% more efficient than MCP)
- [ ] Share in r/LocalLLaMA, r/ClaudeAI, r/webdev, r/node, r/javascript
- [ ] Tweet thread with benchmark highlights, tag AI devtool accounts
- [ ] Post in Claude Discord, Cursor community

### Week 3-4: Content

- [ ] Write Dev.to tutorial: "Browser automation for AI agents without the token tax"
- [ ] Create a 2-min demo video/GIF showing bdg vs MCP workflow
- [ ] Post in relevant Discord servers (Claude, Cursor, AI coding communities)
- [ ] Cross-post tutorial to Hashnode, Medium

### Ongoing: Community

- [ ] Respond to every GitHub issue quickly
- [ ] Engage genuinely in discussions
- [ ] Analyze stargazers—who's interested tells you where to focus
- [ ] Celebrate contributors publicly

## GitHub README Optimization

Current README is solid. Consider adding:

- **Demo GIF** at the top (shows it working in 10 seconds)
- **"Used by" section** once you have notable users
- **Star history badge** (social proof)
- **Comparison table** vs alternatives (already have benchmark data)

## What NOT to Do

- Don't pay for ads (developers distrust them)
- Don't spam communities (you'll get banned)
- Don't overpromise ("best tool ever")
- Don't gate anything behind signup
- Don't use marketing jargon ("revolutionary", "game-changing")

## Success Benchmarks

| Milestone | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **100 stars** | Initial traction |
| **500 stars** | Community forming |
| **1,000+ stars** | Legitimate adoption signal |
| **First external contributor** | Real validation |
| **First unsolicited blog post** | Organic growth starting |

## Key Messaging

### One-liner
CLI for AI agents to control Chrome—33% more efficient than MCP.

### Elevator pitch
bdg connects directly to Chrome DevTools Protocol, giving AI agents access to all 644 CDP methods without the token overhead of MCP. Benchmarked 43x more efficient on complex pages.

### Key differentiators
1. Raw access to all 644 CDP methods (not protocol-constrained)
2. Unix philosophy—composable, pipes to jq
3. Self-correcting—errors exposed with semantic exit codes
4. Trainable via Claude Code skills
5. High-level helpers (click, fill, query) when you need them

## Content Ideas

### Blog Posts
- "Why CLI Beats MCP for AI Browser Automation" (from benchmark article)
- "Building a Web Scraper with Claude Code and bdg"
- "Debugging Memory Leaks: A Guide for AI Agents"
- "The Unix Philosophy Applied to AI Tools"

### Tutorials
- Getting started with bdg in 5 minutes
- Form automation with bdg dom commands
- Network inspection and HAR export
- Custom workflows with Claude Code skills

### Comparisons
- bdg vs Puppeteer (when to use which)
- bdg vs Chrome DevTools MCP (benchmark data)
- bdg vs Playwright (different use cases)
